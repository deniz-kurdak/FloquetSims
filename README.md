# Floquet Simulation of Rydberg-Rydberg Interactions

This code base, developed originally by Patrick Banner, is intended to compute Rydberg-Rydberg interactions, modified by the presence of microwave dressing. To accurately calculate the interaction potentials at interaction energies of comparable strength to the microwave dressing a Floquet approach is taken. 

I've made slight modifications to the code, adding some data management and plotting functionality and a couple bug fixes. A later iteration of the code base will expand the simulations to the case of two microwave drives, requiring the use of many-mode Floquet simulations. 

Some notes, including the basics of Floquet theory and a discussion of the structure and usage of this codebase, can be found [on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wfcrtsygdvwt#6a28cd).

There's a neat tutorial of interfacing Jupyter with GitHub --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ENTVJQ-1rM
